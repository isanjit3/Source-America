# Source America - ChangeCounter Application

For the __2020 Source America Design Challenge__, our team partnered with Furnace Hills Coffee, a coffee shop that employs people with developmental disabilities, to build an innovative solution to some of their common problems.

We worked with Chris, a cheerful employee at Furnace Hills that loves to interact with customers. However, there was barriers to working at the front desk, mainly that fact that it can sometimes be hard to count and deliver change back to the customer correct and timely manner.

That is why our team developed __ChangeCounter__ an application to make calculating change a much more intuitive proceess. Simply enter in the amount of change to be returned and the app will tell you exactly how many bills and coins to return.
