For this project we worked with Furnace Hills Coffee, a cafe that employs people with developmental disabiltiies to develop an application to help employees freely operate the cash register. Our application allowed employees with disabiltiies to operate the cash register independely and accurately. The iOS program was built with Swift, Apple's CoreML, YoloV3 model, and the Square-POS API.

## Features
    1. Calculates change from cash transactions using the Square-POS API
    2. Tracks change being handed to the customer by the employee through machine learning from the iPad camera input
    3. Validates the total amount of change given to the customer and lets the person with disabilites know

## Running the Program:
```
xcode-select --print-path
```
```
xcodebuild -list -workspace <your_workspace_name>.xcworkspace
```
